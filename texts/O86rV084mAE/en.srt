1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,862
Alright, guys, I’m down to tell Oedipus’s story

2
00:00:01,862 --> 00:00:04,167
but we all gotta make an effort for monetization, okay?

3
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,213
So, no sensitive words.

4
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:08,375
Still, it’s the story of a guy who kills his dad and screws his mom.

5
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,376
But shh, I said! No demonetizable words!

6
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:11,343
Let’s do this.

7
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:14,059
One fine day, Laius, the king of Thebes, went to consult the oracle

8
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:16,673
because he and his wife, Jocasta, couldn’t have kids.

9
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:19,991
But the oracle’s only answer was some terrible news.

10
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:22,769
If you have a son, he’ll kill you. And he’ll screw his m-

11
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,169
Hold up! What did I say about monetization?

12
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:30,721
Okay, fine. If you have a son, he’ll... kill you. And he’ll screw his mom.

13
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:32,638
Damn. Shit. This is tricky.

14
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:34,723
Hey, honey, how you feeling about sodomy?

15
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:35,753
What did I just say?

16
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:37,941
Oh, right, right! Sorry. Honey? You into onions?

17
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:40,859
Except, apparently, they couldn’t avoid...

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:41,541
Avoid...

19
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,770
See? It’s not that easy.

20
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,006
Avoid eating just onions.

21
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:46,121
And a few months later...

22
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:50,205
Jocasta then handed the newborn to a shepherd to abandon him in the forest.

23
00:00:50,205 --> 00:00:52,703
But the shepherd didn’t have the guts and passed the baby to a colleague.

24
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:54,370
Literally passed the baby, you know?

25
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,818
Perfect! That’s convenient, ‘cause back in Corinth

26
00:00:56,818 --> 00:01:00,218
the king can’t have kids, so I’ll take the baby to him.

27
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:02,833
That’s how the child was raised by the king and queen of Corinth

28
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,400
and became a really handsome guy named Oedipus.

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,220
A super handsome guy who quickly made people jealous.

30
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,070
♪ Mmm mmm lalala ♪

31
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,283
♪ I’m hot, I’m hot ♪

32
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:13,312
♪ Whoa, whoa, I’m hot ♪

33
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:13,969
♪ Me, me ♪

34
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:15,667
Ugh! This guy’s so full of himself!

35
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:18,061
Boo! You were adopted, that’s what!

36
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:19,252
What?!

37
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:22,087
Dad! Mom! They’re saying I was adopted!

38
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:24,250
Ugh! Don’t listen to the haters, son.

39
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,733
Hmm. I’m gonna get to the bottom of this.

40
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:28,781
O Oedipus, you’ll kill your dad and screw your m-

41
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:29,862
Monetization!

42
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:32,616
You’ll kill your dad and screw your mom.

43
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:35,725
What? No way! I gotta leave town now!

44
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:37,980
Yup, you can see the big mix-up coming.

45
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,247
So our hero hits the road to avoid killing his dad

46
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:42,430
or screwing his mom.

47
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,341
But on the way, he runs into Laius, his real dad, without knowing, of course.

48
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:48,080
Hey, chill! I go first!

49
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,655
Hey, no, no, no! I go first!

50
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:50,431
No, me!

51
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:51,264
No, me!

52
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:52,036
No, me!

53
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:54,062
We said: Monetization!

54
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:58,890
Oh, right. Uh... Put the guy to sleep, the kid who... who sleeps...

55
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,928
And so, without knowing he just killed his own dad,

56
00:02:01,928 --> 00:02:04,629
Oedipus keeps going and arrives in his hometown: Thebes.

57
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:08,187
But at the city gates, there’s a monster terrorizing everyone: the Sphinx.

58
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:11,078
Me, Oedipus, I’ll rid Thebes of the Sphinx.

59
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:14,376
Easy, buddy! I’m gonna give you a riddle, and if you don’t answer, I’ll eat you.

60
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:17,505
What’s the only being on Earth with one voice, one nature,

61
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,458
but has two feet, three feet, and four feet?

62
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,346
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock...

63
00:02:20,346 --> 00:02:25,044
Pfft, that’s super easy. It’s man. ‘Cause when he’s born, he crawls on all fours.

64
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,696
When he grows up, he walks on two.

65
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:29,464
And when he’s old, he uses a cane and walks on three, that’s it.

66
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:30,081
What?!

67
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:30,947
You suck or what?

68
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:33,961
Nooo! I can’t handle failure!

69
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:38,094
My dad was right. I’m just a freak of nature.

70
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:42,281
Yeah, what’s up with having lion paws and a woman’s head...

71
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:46,009
Congrats, Oedipus, you saved us from that monster.

72
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:49,592
To thank you, we offer you the hand of our queen, Jocasta,

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:53,091
who’s now a widow since some idiot killed her husband on the road.

74
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:55,622
Got it? The queen of Thebes is Oedipus’s mom.

75
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:57,510
Who he’s gonna marry, then. Yup, yup, yup.

76
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,790
And that’s how he screwed his mom a whole lot

77
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,823
and they even had kids. Gross.

78
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:04,076
And the gods couldn’t allow that

79
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:07,041
‘cause you can’t screw your mom, even by accident.

80
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,241
So a curse fell on Thebes

81
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:11,574
and the women became barren, and nothing grew anymore.

82
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:15,072
While trying to break the curse, Oedipus learned the awful truth.

83
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,841
He had killed his real dad and screwed his mom-wife...

84
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:19,841
His mom-wife...

85
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,488
She killed herself in disgust

86
00:03:21,488 --> 00:03:24,257
and Oedipus gouged out his own eyes and banished himself from the city.

87
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:25,058
End of the story.

88
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:27,658
And boom, monetization! We didn’t say “screw his mom” once!

89
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:28,477
Whoops!

90
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:29,073
Shit.

91
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:30,570
Thanks for watching this video

92
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,837

And subscribe, of course!

95
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:40,419
Don’t forget there’s an animated episode every first Wednesday of the month at noon.

96
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:42,671
When you hear the siren, it’s cartoon time.

97
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:45,304
See you for the next one on Wednesday, January 6.

98
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:49,385
Here we go: ♫ Lililililou, I’m hot. Whoa, whoa, I’m hot ♫

99
00:03:49,385 --> 00:03:52,322
♫ Who’s hot? It’s me. Yup, yup ♫

100
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:54,777
I can’t handle failure!

101
00:03:57,997 --> 00:04:01,549
They dare say you were adopted? They’re liars.

102
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,383
I’m gonna go sodom... uh...

103
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:09,146
Oh, right! Uh... Put the guy to sleep, the kid who... puts to sleep...

104
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:13,850
Put to sleep so... you’re not in... Mao’s camp.

105
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,782
Yeah, I’m looking for a rhyme.

106
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:19,247
No, no, no, no, I go first. Right of way. Like in the government.

107
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:20,053
There you go!
