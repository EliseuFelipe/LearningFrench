2
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:09,450
Have you always dreamed of making your

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,740
own homemade croissants? Well, you're in luck,

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,839
because we're here for that, to

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:15,179
explain a recipe that's a little bit

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,340
technical, yes, but not too much. You'll

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,869
see, in the end, the result is

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,039
"I made it myself." Try it, but

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:20,789
I'm stuck here, I can tell you that

10
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,679
you'll be able to show off.

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,090
Okay, let's get started then.

12
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,730
We'll begin by making a détrempe.

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:35,400
So, for the dough, we'll use

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,800
sugar, salt, and yeast. The yeast

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,300
can be dry or fresh, whatever

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,200
you prefer.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,490
And milk. The important thing is

18
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,810
to knead very gently,

19
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,000
because if you knead too much,

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,890
the dough becomes too elastic, and

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,960
for making puff pastry, that

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,400
makes things a bit complicated. So, don't

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,200
knead too much, use a very low speed.

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,810
We go slowly and knead as little

25
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,630
as possible. As soon as the dough

26
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,060
starts to form a ball, we stop

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,890
very, very quickly, okay? Because

28
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,509
the problem with the mixer is that

29
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:11,460
we tend to overwork the dough.

30
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,140
You really, really need to avoid

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,429
that elasticity, okay? The détrempe

32
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:15,090
should be a bit like this, so

33
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,420
I can work with it.

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,009
I shape it into a ball and, see, if

35
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,420
it's not perfectly mixed,

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,880
that's okay, we'll finish it by hand.

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,600
The important thing is that it’s not too elastic.

38
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:26,600
It's ready.

39
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,680
There, it's good, it's ready. I didn't

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,990
knead too much, it's not

41
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,470
elastic at all, see? Perfect.

42
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,300
Okay, now we wrap the dough

43
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,200
in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,630
overnight.

45
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,150
Two hours is enough, but

46
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,960
ideally, a whole night to make it

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,670
perfect. The détrempe has rested well,

48
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,970
so we see it’s much less

49
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,590
elastic, and now we’ll roll it out.

50
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,350
I sprinkle a little flour and

51
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,380
we’ll place it on the work surface.

52
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,010
Now, we’ll do the tourage.

53
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,010
That’s it.

54
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,590
I take my butter, which needs

55
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,079
to be at room temperature or

56
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:26,239
slightly softened.

57
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,349
I place it in the middle, see?

58
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:30,340
It’s like a pizza, except

59
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,370
we replaced the tomato sauce with butter.

60
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:34,930
Otherwise, it’s more than a pizza.

61
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,790
Let’s go.

62
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,400
I fold the dough, not pressing too hard,

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,109
and I’ll fold it from all four sides,

64
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:44,930
like a wallet.

65
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,209
Taking care to keep the butter

66
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:51,919
right in the middle, well sealed. We have a

67
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,989
dough with the butter in the center.

68
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:55,909
Okay, that’s good, what you’re

69
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,280
doing is great, because it prevents

70
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,310
squashing everything, it’s a very good move.

71
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,530
And now, we do the classic: we fold

72
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,199
in three, that’s it, just fold.

73
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,250
Seven layers, perfect.

74
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,319
And there, no overlaps, it’s

75
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,199
perfect. I’ll wrap the dough.

76
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,489
We wrap it to keep it from

77
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,349
drying out, and we’ll let it rest in

78
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:22,970
the fridge for 10 to 15 minutes, at least.

79
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,829
One or two hours is fine,

80
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,299
meaning I could even do this

81
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:27,470
the day before,

82
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,669
leave it overnight and

83
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:30,560
continue the next day, okay?

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,909
To the fridge.

85
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:33,379
Alright, now a bit of flour,

86
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,229
I sprinkle lightly and, like before,

87
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:40,900
we already have nine layers. See? We multiply

88
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,970
by three, we get to 27 different

89
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,919
layers between the dough and the butter.

90
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,209
We finish the second tourage, and the

91
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,549
important thing, see, is to always keep

92
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:51,349
a nice side. If one side is

93
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:52,549
less pretty, it’s better to put it

94
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,739
inside. We do the same, folding

95
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:56,599
like a wallet, in three.

96
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,569
And again, we wrap the dough,

97
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:02,680
without letting it dry out, and put it in

98
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,180
the fridge for at least 20 minutes,

99
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:13,980
to let the dough rest between

100
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,629
the tourages.

101
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,070
Now, we’ll do the last tourage.

102
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,500
We have 27 different layers,

103
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,329
I place the dough on the work surface

104
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,330
and we’ll do the final tourage.

105
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,039
Done, it’s perfect.

106
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:27,750
Third and final tourage, we fold in three,

107
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,070
just press lightly to

108
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,729
bind the last three layers together,

109
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:41,060
okay? And now, when it’s nice and cold,

110
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,080
we’ll use it. It’s nice and even,

111
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,759
like this, well sealed by the cold.

112
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,650
We wrap it one last time and

113
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,630
put it in the fridge for at least

114
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,910
one hour, to have a dough that’s

115
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,860
not too elastic, so you can

116
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,330
succeed with your viennoiseries.

117
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,199
Now, we’ll roll out and shape.

118
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,820
It’s important to stay logical, to keep

119
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,139
a nice shape, with 3 to 4 mm

120
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,599
thickness, not too thin.

121
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:05,160
So, we go slowly, trying

122
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,380
to maintain the shape to roll out

123
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,430
the dough correctly.

124
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,280
We roll it out well, perfect.

125
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,599
I sprinkle a bit of flour as a

126
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:15,720
precaution, there. Now, we’ll

127
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,190
cut it into triangles, like this,

128
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,139
this way, chop.

129
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,320
Done, we keep the shape of

130
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,289
the whole strip.

131
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:30,180
We cut them all into triangles and

132
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,070
here’s a little trick:

133
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,030
I make a small incision at the base,

134
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,720
this is optional, but it helps to

135
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,340
roll the croissant.

136
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,050
Now, I apply a little beaten egg

137
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,580
to ensure the croissant stays

138
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,780
well sealed. This is optional,

139
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,720
but it helps. A bit of moisture,

140
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,130
done. I take the two ends and

141
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,440
start rolling.

142
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,690
I press a little, but not too much,

143
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,039
and I roll, roll, and can pull the

144
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,150
tip to make a nice croissant.

145
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,650
There, we have small, simple

146
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,530
croissants, all uniform.

147
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,789
Now, we place parchment paper and

148
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:06,050
let them rise in the warmest corner

149
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,430
of your kitchen for about

150
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:12,850
an hour, until they double in volume.

151
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,670
Then, we brush with a bit of beaten egg.

152
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:21,880
See, it’s super simple.

153
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,970
Our croissants have risen well, they’ve

154
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,100
almost doubled in volume. We made a

155
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,510
mixture of two eggs, beaten like

156
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,740
an omelet, very simple.

157
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,780
We brush the egg, without overdoing it, and

158
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,810
preheat the oven to 180°C.

159
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,180
We’ll bake for 15 to 20 minutes.

160
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,410
The croissants are very well

161
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,020
flaky, you can see the work

162
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,880
was well done. They’re super crispy.

163
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,110
Just let them cool a bit and

164
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,570
enjoy. We hope we’ve made you want

165
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,590
to make your homemade croissants.

166
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,660
Seriously, they’re delicious.

167
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,580
You can even prepare them in advance,

168
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,690
freeze them raw, and then

169
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,780
let them rise on Sunday

170
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,310
morning, at 5 a.m., no problem.

171
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,160
When the family wakes up, you’ll have

172
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,220
amazing croissants, super delicious.

173
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,720
See you soon!
