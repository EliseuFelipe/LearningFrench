Hello, my little earthworms,

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,100
so today I’m gonna talk about a kinda special animal

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,220
The tardigrade

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,200
The tardigrade is a microscopic invertebrate

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,880
it lives in soil, moss, or sand

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,520
a tardigrade looks like this, it’s also called a water bear

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,720
it’s invisible to the naked eye and the biggest ones are less than a millimeter

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,680
the tardigrade is famous for its superpowers

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,360
I’m a tardigrade and I’m invincible

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,500
stop thinking tardigrades are immortal

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,480
shit

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,360
whoops... I said shit

13
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,180
its survival skills are only possible thanks to cryptobiosis

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,040
it’s like a form of hibernation, but extreme

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,740
super, super, super extreme!

16
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,460
yep, you heard right, I’m an extremophile

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,180
the tardigrade only enters this state when facing unfavorable living conditions

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,040
and to do that, it dehydrates itself

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,340
But the most impressive thing is it can stay in this state for centuries, even millennia

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,060
here’s Jean Michel, in cryptobiosis for eight hundred and fifty-two years now

21
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,940
and what’s particularly incredible is that the tardigrade

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,940
in cryptobiosis can withstand extreme cold, extreme heat

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,760
vacuum, pressure, radiation, lack of water, and food

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,520
in short, the tardigrade is incredible in every way

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,320
it’s immortal

26
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:38,520
or not

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,949
don’t believe it, the tardigrade, when not in cryptobiosis, is a living being as vulnerable as you and me

28
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,409
vulnerable, just to remind you, means it can die

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,420
I’m Mr. Tardigrade and I’ll make mincemeat out of Chuck Norris

30
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,020
scientists recently brought tardigrades back to life

31
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,080
that were 2000 years old!

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,160
cryptobiosis + water = tardigrade awake

33
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,060
The tardigrade doesn’t get wet, it’s the water that gets tardigraded

34
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,500
it’s kinda like powdered eggs, right

35
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,320
It’s recently been proven that the tardigrade is vulnerable to high temperatures

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,180
when not in cryptobiosis, and its lethal temperature is

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,300
37.6 degrees

38
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,160
imagine all those little tardigrades that died during heatwaves

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,880
so you’re telling me the invincible tardigrade can die because of global warming

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,540
So, if you too want to fight for the tardigrade cause, I invite you to protect your planet

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,060
so that even the tiny microscopic world we don’t see can be protected

42
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,630
thanks

43
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,020
so, isn’t nature awesome?

44
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,149
by Osiris and Apis, look at me, look closely, you’re a tardigrade, I repeat, a tardigrade
