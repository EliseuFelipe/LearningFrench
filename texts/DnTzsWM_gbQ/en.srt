1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,670
Fukushima, Chernobyl.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,960
These two nuclear accidents caused
radioactive releases

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,280
harmful to health.

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,680
In Fukushima, the number of victims
from radioactivity is estimated

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,880
between one and a thousand deaths.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,750
In Chernobyl, between 4,000 and
60,000 deaths.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,050
So, is nuclear power dangerous?

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:39,380
Well, yes, but what is less known
is that nuclear energy

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,030
has also done something else.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,910
It has saved lives,
hundreds of thousands of lives.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,130
In fact, nuclear power
is above all a matter of balance

12
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,340
between dangers, risks, and benefits.

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,070
To see more clearly,
let’s first look at where the danger comes from.

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,040
In a nuclear power plant,
there is a reactor and, inside it,

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,100
uranium.

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,560
The atoms of this uranium do
two things.

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,300
One, they naturally disintegrate,
releasing radiation.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,790
Two, some of them split
in two, releasing even

19
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,300
more radiation,
but also energy.

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,810
This is what allows the generation
of electricity.

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,520
The problem is that all this
radiation is very harmful

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,480
to health.

23
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,140
It can kill a human in a few
seconds.

24
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,450
This is exactly why the reactor
is enclosed in a structure

25
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,840
of steel or concrete nearly
a meter thick.

26
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,950
Outside this barrier,
there is no danger.

27
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,240
The problem is when something breaks.

28
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:07,650
Chernobyl, April 1986.

29
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,130
The reactor explosion kills two
people and causes the emission

30
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,090
of radiation.

31
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,650
It irradiates nearby people,
including 29 firefighters who

32
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,850
die in the following days.

33
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,070
At the same time, a large
quantity of radioactive particles

34
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,510
is released into the environment.

35
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,510
If they reach living beings,
they can contaminate them and

36
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,670
promote the onset of cancers.

37
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,000
So, how many people died
in the long term due to

38
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,680
radiation and contamination?

39
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,250
Estimates range between 4,000
and 60,000 deaths.

40
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,970
This wide uncertainty is explained
by three reasons.

41
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,510
First, the USSR authorities

42
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,630
communicated little about the analysis
of radioactive fallout.

43
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,970
Second reason, there was no
explosion in the number of diseases

44
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,020
after the disaster.

45
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,790
And so, among all the diseases
observed, it is difficult to detect

46
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,310
which ones were caused by
contamination.

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,390
Last difficulty,
diseases can take

48
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,590
time to manifest.

49
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,700
It will therefore take decades
for all the contaminated people

50
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,890
to actually die.

51
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,480
According to the World Health
Organization, the death toll could

52
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,530
reach up to 4,000,
an estimate based on the work

53
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,460
of several United Nations agencies,
including UNSCEAR,

54
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,970
a sort of IPCC made up of
radiation specialists.

55
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,880
25 years later, in Fukushima.

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,130
Following the earthquake,
the tsunami, and the nuclear accident,

57
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,550
the evacuation of the area caused 2,200
deaths, according to Japanese authorities.

58
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,510
The radiation, for its part,

59
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,200
killed one person from lung
cancer in 2018.

60
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,610
Today, estimates range between one
and a thousand deaths in the long term.

61
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,440
So, this is what we know about the impact
of nuclear disasters.

62
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,630
Now, let’s compare it to other

63
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,820
energy sources, as they too
can kill.

64
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,000
To clarify,
let’s look at the number of deaths per

65
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,680
100 terawatt-hours produced.

66
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,180
100 terawatt-hours, roughly,
is the energy consumption

67
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,020
of France in two weeks.

68
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,520
Here’s what it looks like for solar
and wind power.

69
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,330
Two deaths and four deaths,
respectively, for every 100 terawatt-hours

70
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,280
produced.

71
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,240
They are mainly due to accidents
during construction

72
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,230
or maintenance.

73
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,190
For hydroelectric power,
there are two deaths.

74
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,240
This is mainly due to
dam failures that can

75
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,360
kill dozens, hundreds, or even,

76
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,700
on one occasion in China,
tens of thousands

77
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,790
of people.

78
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,750
That’s for renewable energies.

79
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,760
Now, let’s move on to fossil fuels.

80
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,640
For gas, there are 282 deaths,
always per 100 terawatt-hours.

81
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,300
Oil, 1,843, coal,
2,462, and lignite,

82
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:17,460
a lower-quality coal,
3,272.

83
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,330
Most of these deaths result
from the pollution emitted by

84
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,800
fossil fuels.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,760
These are harmful gases and
fine particles that cause

86
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,450
respiratory and
cardiovascular diseases.

87
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,030
It is estimated that, every year,
this pollution kills 3.6 million

88
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,680
people.

89
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,640
To this, add the accidents
during the extraction of gas,

90
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,590
coal, or oil.

91
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,360
Lignite, therefore, kills 12 times more
than gas, which itself kills 140

92
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,200
times more than solar.

93
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,370
And nuclear power in all this?

94
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,380
It’s here, seven deaths per 100
terawatt-hours.

95
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,640
The figure accounts for accidents
at all stages

96
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,410
of the production cycle,
the WHO’s estimate of 4,000 deaths

97
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,130
in Chernobyl, and the victims of
Fukushima.

98
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,620
Based on these differences
in mortality, a study estimated

99
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,800
that, by replacing fossil fuels,
nuclear power has prevented

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,270
a large amount of atmospheric
pollution that would have killed

101
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,960
nearly two million people
between 1976 and 2009.

102
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,520
What we see, then, is that despite
the inherent dangers of nuclear power,

103
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,190
its damages remain moderate compared
to other energy sources.

104
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,090
And this relies on another concept,
risk.

105
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,960
Risk defines the probability
that problems will occur.

106
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,280
In the case of nuclear power,
managing this risk requires

107
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,080
resources.

108
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,040
It is necessary to monitor the plants,
control anomalies,

109
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,760
maintain and renovate facilities,
and plan for devices in case

110
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:03,250
of accidents.

111
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,210
Until today,
this risk has been relatively well managed.

112
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,010
The question is whether
it will always be in the future.

113
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,550
This will depend, on one hand, on controllable
parameters, such as maintenance

114
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,470
of technical expertise,
invested resources, and sustained

115
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,370
vigilance.

116
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,330
And, on the other, on uncertainties
such as natural disasters,

117
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,890
technical failures,
the evolution of human activities,

118
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,760
and so on.

119
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,720
This risk issue also appears
in another aspect of the nuclear question:

120
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,260
the management of radioactive waste.

121
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,620
It includes many things:
the tools and clothing used

122
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,030
in the plants, the debris
from the dismantling of these

123
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,360
plants, or even the remains
of the uranium used in the

124
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,870
reactors.

125
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,830
Today, in France,
91% of this waste is low

126
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:59,230
or moderately radioactive and will
remain so for a few years

127
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,950
or centuries.

128
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,910
They can be stored on the surface
until they are no longer

129
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,750
dangerous.

130
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,710
6% are low-level radioactive,
but will remain so for a long time,

131
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:14,290
tens or even hundreds
of thousands of years.

132
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,200
It is considered to bury them at several
tens of meters.

133
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,210
The remaining 3% are highly radioactive
and will remain so for

134
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,760
hundreds of thousands of years.

135
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,290
The idea is to bury them deep,
500 meters underground.

136
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,850
In all cases, the issue
of risk arises, human risks,

137
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,940
but also natural risks.

138
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,700
Especially in the case of highly
radioactive waste, whose risk extends

139
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,190
over hundreds of thousands of years.

140
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,840
This is why long-term
storage projects,

141
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,440
like Cigéo in France,
undertake significant work

142
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,470
of anticipation.

143
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,430
After the danger and risks,
there remains the question of benefits.

144
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,930
And there is one that is central,
the fight against global

145
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,120
warming.

146
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,080
To understand, let’s revisit our
comparison with other energy

147
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,730
sources.

148
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,690
On one hand, the number of deaths.

149
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,340
And on the other, the emissions of
greenhouse gases per 100

150
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,520
terawatt-hours of electricity produced.

151
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,410
Fossil fuels are highly
emitting, several tens

152
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,240
of millions of tons each.

153
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,530
For renewables,
it’s much less,

154
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,680
between a few hundred and a few
million tons.

155
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,710
And for nuclear power,
300,000 tons per 100 terawatt-hours.

156
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,240
That’s 270 times less than coal,
for example.

157
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,630
Now, greenhouse gases cause
global warming.

158
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,560
And according to IPCC analyses,
it puts many people at risk of death.

159
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,400
Low-emission energy sources
are therefore necessary to limit it,

160
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,800
including nuclear power.

161
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,810
Well, whether with the plants
or the waste, nuclear power represents

162
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:08,690
a certain level of danger,
indeed.

163
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,010
The risk, on the other hand, depends on many
factors, but some are

164
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,380
controllable.

165
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,340
In parallel, finally,
we must consider the significant

166
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,910
benefit in the fight against
global warming.

167
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,640
It is by taking these
three parameters into account that we can evaluate

168
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,030
nuclear energy correctly.

169
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,100
Thank you for watching this video.

170
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,850
We hope you enjoyed it.

171
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,840
There is one aspect we haven’t addressed,
which is the question of whether

172
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,810
the existence of nuclear power plants
can promote the proliferation

173
