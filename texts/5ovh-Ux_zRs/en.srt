1
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:09,473
The other day I learned
a new word in French.

2
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:12,977
My friend and I had just moved
into a new apartment,

3
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:16,486
and our new neighbors were telling us
that we were living in what used to be

4
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:17,931
a 'passementerie' factory.

5
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:23,660
And I had no idea what
they were talking about.

6
00:00:23,686 --> 00:00:27,458
And so I asked them
what "passementerie" meant.

7
00:00:29,448 --> 00:00:31,843
Actually, I didn't exactly ask them that.

8
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:37,914
It was something more like:
"An old factory for what?"

9
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:40,639
I don't know this word,
what does it mean?

10
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:43,202
And so they explained it to me.

11
00:00:43,228 --> 00:00:50,177
"You know, it was a factory
where they made tassels, ribbons, lace.

12
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:52,989
All of that is called
a passementerie."

13
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:55,973
I asked them to repeat
this word again,

14
00:00:55,973 --> 00:01:01,974
at least two or three times,
until I was unable to keep it in my head.

15
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:06,348
And in the following weeks,
it popped up several times

16
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:09,207
in conversations with my friend,

17
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:13,423
and each time I was incapable
of saying it myself,

18
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:17,579
even though from that point on
I was able to recognize it perfectly fine

19
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,949
and knew what it meant.

20
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,505
In fact, it wasn't until
preparing this talk

21
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:27,970
that you are about to hear
that I learned it for good,

22
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,680
thanks to the fact that I wrote it down.

23
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:34,688
The way I learn French words
is through writing.

24
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:41,514
It's rather frustrating,
but if I can't see them black on white,

25
00:01:41,514 --> 00:01:44,594
then I am incapable of remembering them.

26
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:51,314
I was thrown by my own difficulties
in learning words

27
00:01:51,314 --> 00:01:55,573
in my second language,
especially as I had often seen

28
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,668
some human beings
who did not have the same problems at all.

29
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:04,243
They are all small, they have difficulties
in eating with a fork,

30
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:06,731
they don't know how to dress themselves.

31
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:11,307
In short, it all leads one to believe
that they are not very clever.

32
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:17,362
And yet, they are geniuses
when it comes to learning languages.

33
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:21,722
Obviously, I'm talking about babies.

34
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:25,890
In my research work,

35
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:29,670
I study how babies learn
their mother tongue.

36
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:32,768
And just like all my colleagues,
I was fascinated

37
00:02:32,768 --> 00:02:36,348
by the speed with which they learn.

38
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:42,951
Going back to words, did you know
that babies begin to recognize

39
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:47,229
their own first name
at the age of 4 or 5 months?

40
00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:49,510
And that shortly afterward
they already understand

41
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,834
several other words
like "feeding bottle" or "banana"?

42
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:00,747
To realize how miraculous
this is at that point,

43
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:05,274
thin about the obstacles
that babies must overcome.

44
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:07,778
So, let's put ourselves
in babies' shoes for a second.

45
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:13,084
For this, there's nothing better
than to listen to a mother speaking

46
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:16,021
to her baby in a language foreign to us.

47
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:18,790
Here we go.

48
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:24,044
Imagine being the baby
of this Chinese mother.

49
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:32,142
(Spoken Chinese)

50
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:37,042
A natural reaction would be,
"I don't understand anything at all!"

51
00:03:37,673 --> 00:03:39,760
"I understand that Mom is
speaking to me

52
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:43,313
and I know by the tone of her voice
that she loves me a lot.

53
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:48,841
But where to begin learning my language
and knowing what she is saying to me?"

54
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,282
Here is the problem.

55
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:56,258
The baby's task is a feat in itself

56
00:03:56,258 --> 00:04:00,243
since it can do nothing
but hear sounds lacking meaning.

57
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:06,543
Do you remember how I learned
the word 'passementerie'?

58
00:04:06,543 --> 00:04:09,543
First, I identified it in a sentence

59
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:14,409
where I knew all the other words.
Somehow, the word went past my ears.

60
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,110
Then, I asked for an explanation
for it from other people

61
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,665
and finally I wrote it down
in order to retain it better.

62
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,373
For babies,
learning can't happen like this.

63
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:30,636
Firstly, because, from the outset,
they don't know any other word.

64
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:37,070
So that means that their first challenge
is discovering where words begin

65
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,136
and end in sentences.

66
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:43,380
Before coming here, you were thinking
that maybe words

67
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:46,466
are separated
by small instances of silence,

68
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:53,565
in the same way that written words
in sentences are separated by spaces.

69
00:04:55,513 --> 00:04:57,291
In fact, it is nothing like that.

70
00:04:57,317 --> 00:05:00,159
And I hope that by listening
to that Chinese mother,

71
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:06,291
you have realized that words,
for the most part, are stuck together.

72
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:10,007
I assure you that to babies at this point

73
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:12,583
French sounds just like Chinese.

74
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:17,659
Our impression of thinking that,
when one hears a sentence in French,

75
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:21,516
it is the most effortless thing
to chop it up into words

76
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,966
is due to the fact that we recognize
these words, one after the other.

77
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:29,680
For example, when I say to you:

78
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:34,252
"Today many people have spoken
to me on the street,"

79
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:39,809
you recognize the words
"today," "many," etc.

80
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:45,066
This is what creates the illusion
that words are detached units.

81
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:50,489
But even if babies find a solution

82
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:53,862
and end up knowing
where words begin or end,

83
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:58,389
what can they do to
learn the meanings?

84
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:02,070
For me, it was easy.

85
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,404
I simply asked for an explanation.

86
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:07,903
And since I know what lace,
ribbons, and tassels are,

87
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:14,251
I could guess the meaning
of the mystery word: passementerie.

88
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:19,275
Unfortunately, babies cannot ask
for explanations

89
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,767
since they have no language
with which to do so.

90
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:28,396
And what's more, it wouldn't help
if the parents paraphrased the words,

91
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:31,455
because the babies do not understand
these other words either.

92
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:37,995
I want to remind you that I had
difficulties in retaining the new word

93
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:40,901
and that I could not do so
until the day I wrote it down.

94
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:47,381
What do babies do to memorize
new words all the time?

95
00:06:48,335 --> 00:06:54,006
Once they have begun, they can learn
between five to ten new words a day.

96
00:06:54,953 --> 00:06:59,111
And often it is enough for them
to hear the word just once

97
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,266
with no fear of forgetting it.

98
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:06,261
Of course, this wasn't about showing you
how babies learn

99
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:08,675
without being able to write down words.

100
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:16,524
I think that now we all agree
that learning one's mother tongue

101
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:17,908
is not something obvious.

102
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:21,273
And at this point,
you will surely want to ask me:

103
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:25,297
"Well, then, how do babies learn words?"

104
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,691
Or better yet, perhaps you have
some ideas on it.

105
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:35,272
One example is the belief

106
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:39,357
that parents somehow teach words
to their babies.

107
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:45,563
They point toward an object,
let's say a kitten, and say:

108
00:07:45,563 --> 00:07:48,391
"Oh, look, it's a kitten!"

109
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:55,725
It is true that you're right, in part.

110
00:07:56,602 --> 00:08:02,630
Some research has shown that babies
are, in effect, aided by pointing

111
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,360
as well as by their parents looking
at the objects they are talking about.

112
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:11,596
But that cannot explain everything,
for many reasons.

113
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:19,566
For example, how do babies know which part
of the sentence to pay attention to

114
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,444
when their parents point at a small cat?

115
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:28,502
And once the word "kitten"
is correctly identified,

116
00:08:28,502 --> 00:08:33,130
how do they know
that it designates the entire cat,

117
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,725
and not its ears, the color of its fur,

118
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:40,890
the way it tries to catch its tail,
or its purring?

119
00:08:42,107 --> 00:08:45,346
What's more, babies begin to learn words

120
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:48,584
well before understanding pointing.

121
00:08:49,043 --> 00:08:53,533
Out of necessity, they must then have
other mechanisms of learning.

122
00:08:55,857 --> 00:09:01,961
For quite a while, research has allowed us
to better understand these mechanisms.

123
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:08,366
It has been discovered
that babies are excellent statisticians.

124
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:14,030
They gather all sorts of information
related to a word

125
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,656
and inherently make calculations on it,

126
00:09:17,728 --> 00:09:22,181
like finding out
where words begin and end.

127
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:25,974
Let's take an example.

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,489
When babies hear the syllable "bo,"

129
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:32,134
the chances are good
that the next syllable will be "ttle,"

130
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,250
simply because "bottle" is a word
frequently heard in their life.

131
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:43,579
But it is more difficult to predict
which syllables will follow "ttle."

132
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:50,471
It could be "'s empty,"
as in: "The bottle's empty."

133
00:09:50,471 --> 00:09:55,333
Or "on," as in:
"I put the bottle on the table."

134
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:57,160
And so on.

135
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:04,309
Thus, babies retain all these patterns
of occurrence between syllables

136
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:08,007
and that permits them to conclude
that "bottle" is a word,

137
00:10:08,126 --> 00:10:11,730
but "bottle'sempty"
and "bottleon" are not.

138
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,401
In the same vein, they remember
which words they hear in which situation,

139
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:21,852
which helps them to guess
the meanings of the words.

140
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:27,740
They can hear the word "bottle"
in plenty of different situations,

141
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,375
but their majority will have
the common element

142
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:34,086
of a feeding bottle being present.

143
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:43,318
As a child, every summer I would spend
2-3 weeks' vacation with my parents

144
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,558
in a foreign country.

145
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:49,261
So, very early, I heard
other languages besides mine

146
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:54,996
and I loved learning other words
or sentences in a foreign language.

147
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:59,046
My passion for languages
was already revealed.

148
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,099
And I would even say
that these summer vacations

149
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:05,286
put me on the path
to my current profession.

150
00:11:06,563 --> 00:11:12,324
For example, hearing three-year-olds
speak better French than my parents

151
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:15,260
always left me a little dumbstruck.

152
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,240
Of course, I knew that this was normal

153
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:21,184
since these children were French,

154
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,551
But I also felt that there was something
enigmatic about it all.

155
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:33,226
Today, this enigma
is the subject of my research.

156
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:39,473
After a certain age,
we go through plenty of difficulty

157
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:41,734
trying to learn a foreign language.

158
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:46,918
But babies, however
small and vulnerable they might be,

159
00:11:46,944 --> 00:11:52,475
learn their mother tongue
without obvious effort.

160
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,596
In the past 30 years, we've begun
to understand how they do it.

161
00:12:00,477 --> 00:12:03,924
But the question will continue to keep
us wondering for a long time.

162
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:08,690
Whatever the case may be,
all this research

163
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,397
and all these discoveries
take nothing away from the marvel

164
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:17,369
that parents experience
when their baby says its first word.

165
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:19,388
Thank you.

166
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:23,514
(Applause)
