1 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440 (Pulls the string)

2 00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,980 Alright

3 00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,940 How does this little top

4 00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,920 just stay balanced

5 00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,540 on a tiny string like that

6 00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,420 it’s (...) incredible, right?!

7 00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,080 Alright

8 00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,120 Since I started this video format

9 00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,600 where I show you amazing objects

10 00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,300 Right from the first episode, I saw in the comments

11 00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,260 Talk about the gyroscope

12 00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,120 Show the gyroscope

13 00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,620 The gyroscope is

14 00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,160 Whoa, mind-blowing!

15 00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,760 And so on

16 00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,220 Okay, alright, I was totally planning to do it

17 00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,020 So, here it is:

18 00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,220 THE GYROSCOPE

19 00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,880 The ultimate scientific toy

20 00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,800 And for once, this one’s not too expensive

21 00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,840 Okay, so check out what you can do with a gyroscope:

22 00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,100 It’s basically a spinning top

23 00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,020 ANOTHER TOP, NO WAY

24 00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,020 Okay, yeah, but this is next-level:

25 00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,280 With this string

26 00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,100 (Pulls the string)

27 00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,720 I give it a spin, right

28 00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,720 Alright, it spins crazy fast, we’re on the same page

29 00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520 But more importantly, now I can place it pretty much anywhere

30 00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,160 And it’ll stay in place

31 00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,080 See, you guys saw, it’s kinda wild what’s happening here

32 00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,040 (Laughter)

33 00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,760 Alright

34 00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,580 I can balance the thing wherever I want, and it’ll keep its balance

35 00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,320 And keep its balance, just like that

36 00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,520 There, I can

37 00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,020 pick it up again

38 00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,540 Put it here, there, done

39 00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,040 Gyroscope

40 00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,260 What’s amazing is that I can

41 00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,660 Put it in situations where normally

42 00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,860 The thing would fall, right

43 00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,040 Where it wouldn’t stay in place

44 00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200 No, it doesn’t care about that

45 00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,540 And that’s exactly what’s amazing

46 00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,180 Sorry, but

47 00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,300 (Pulls the string)

48 00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,860 this

49 00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,800 is not normal

50 00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,400 (Laughter)

51 00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,440 Wow

52 00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,920 (The gyroscope falls)

53 00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,200 In a gyroscope

54 00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,820 We have a wheel, like this:

55 00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,280 Here we go, a little stroboscopic effect that’s always cool

56 00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,620 Always a hit

57 00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,500 So, a wheel that spins around this axis

58 00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,440





Katana Nozman *

59 00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,180 What’s around it is there to keep

60 00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,800 the gyroscope steady

61 00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,880 Just like that, it’s already pretty

62 00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,020 So, what’s going on and what do we see

63 00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,880 When I get the wheel spinning

64 00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,300 and place the object in weird positions

65 00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,420 It stays balanced

66 00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,240 Like this, it almost doesn’t seem surprising

67 00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,080 But in this direction

68 00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,340 it’s way weirder, we agree

69 00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,140 So, it doesn’t fall

70 00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,640 Nothing

71 00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,160 Nada

72 00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,660 Zilch

73 00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,160 Alright, awesome

74 00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,040 So why, when I hold my gyroscope

75 00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,540 like this

76 00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,520 doesn’t it fall

77 00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,440 well, that’s the whole point of the object, really

78 00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,380 because the gyroscope

79 00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,180 wants to keep its angular momentum

80 00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,500 in fact, it wants to hold onto it as long as possible

81 00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,600 And it doesn’t want to lose it, right

82 00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,600 Angular momentum, basically, is the push given to a spinning motion

83 00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,020 The more speed I give it

84 00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,540 The more I increase its angular momentum

85 00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,080 Angular Momentum

86 00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,580 If you want

87 00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,080 It’s two vectors

88 00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,400 Right, tac tac

89 00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,540 Well, the cross product of those two vectors

90 00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,060 Is perpendicular to those two vectors

91 00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,920 It’s perpendicular to the plane of rotation

92 00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,380 So, in this case

93 00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,540 It goes in this direction, tac

94 00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,400 Angular momentum, got it

95 00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,900 One vector

96 00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,320 Two vectors

97 00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,920 Angular momentum

98 00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,520 Tatatatatatatatata

99 00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,160 Thug life

100 00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,640 So, when the gyroscope is set

101 00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,140 (Pulls the string)

102 00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,140 With its axis of rotation perpendicular to the ground

103 00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,280 Like this

104 00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,100 (Zoom)

105 00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,040 #noproblemwestillloveit

106 00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,700 Well, actually

107 00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800 Its angular momentum is in this direction (vertical)

108 00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,940 Which ultimately forces the object

109 00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,280 to maintain its balance

110 00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,300 for a certain amount of time, right

111 00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,060 because there’s still the action of gravity

112 00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,260 pulling it down bit by bit

113 00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,440 there’s friction

114 00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,900 air resistance, etc.

115 00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,020 so it ends up stopping

116 00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,520 and falling

117 00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,140 that’s inevitable

118 00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,720 (Catches the object that came from space)

119 00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,400 It makes some noise, huh

120 00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,860 Now we’re gonna talk about something called

121 00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,840 PRECESSION

122 00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200 Precession is the change in orientation

123 00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,940 of an object’s axis of rotation

124 00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,840 here, the gyroscope

125 00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,840 But if I place it like this on a pen

126 00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,580 and let it go

127 00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,860 Well, you’d think it’s gonna fall

128 00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,580 due to gravity

129 00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,340 (Falls)

130 00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:00,960 and that’s what happens

131 00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,400 But once it’s spinning

132 00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,440 it doesn’t fall and starts rotating around the pen

133 00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,760 It’s fantastic, isn’t it

134 00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,200 It’s, it’s awesome, we agree

135 00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,020 That’s precession

136 00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,820 The gyroscope has a moment of force in this direction

137 00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,620 And its angular momentum

138 00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,420 In this direction

139 00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,140 The moment of force pushes the angular momentum

140 00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,520 to turn in this direction

141 00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,400 and so the axis of rotation changes orientation

142 00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,140 Once again, gravity is there

143 00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,600 and you know what happens next, right

144 00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600 it only lasts for a while

145 00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,780 I think we can agree that

146 00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,600 this kind of top

147 00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,940 is truly the most incredible top out there

148 00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,460 Alright, this thing is definitely

149 00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,340 totally nuts

150 00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,220 I really hope you liked this gyroscope

151 00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,580 and that you enjoyed the video
